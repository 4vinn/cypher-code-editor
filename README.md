#### Deployed on Railway
<br>

>Made 2 parallel railway services, one serving the frontend and the other serving the backend

Its frontend railway service - https://4vinn-cypher.up.railway.app/ <br>
Its backend railway service  - https://4vinn-cypher-be.up.railway.app/ <br>

<br>

>For that, I restructured my repo into a monorepo, that looks like this:
```
.
├── .gitignore
├── README
├── frontend/
│   ├── public
│   ├── src
│   ├── package.json
│   └── package-lock.json
└── backend/
    ├── server.js
    ├── actions.js
    ├── package.json
    └── package-lock.json
```
<br>

> Created separate `package.json` for each backend and frontend, updated scipts/dependencies accordingly

> Now, The `package-lock.json` file is used by npm to lock down the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent builds across different environments.  <br> Regenerated the `package-lock.json` in each folder using `install --package-lock-only`.

<summary> npm install: </summary>

When you run npm install:

1. It looks at your package.json file and installs the dependencies specified there.

1. If there's a package-lock.json file, it uses it to ensure that the exact versions of the dependencies are installed.

1. It creates or updates the node_modules folder in your project directory, which contains all the installed dependencies.

It also generates a package-lock.json file if one does not exist or updates it to reflect the current state of installed dependencies.
